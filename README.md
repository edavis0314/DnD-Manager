# Eric Davis - IT Programmer Analyst - CCSO

The FinalProjectDM folder contains a program that takes data from a JSON file and processes it into a SQL database. After that it takes in an input and finds any movies similar to the title and and recommends other movies similar to this title. This was written in Java and MySQL.

The Compiler is a program that shows off a Lexical Analyzer and Parcer that can be used to check and see if any code can be used in a language called C-. This language was provided by my professor Dr. Eggen at UNF. This was written in Java.

The Guide for Adventuring is a program that showcases a different solution to C++'s time seeded rand function. This is using Dungeons and Dragons as a venue to show its ability to create random numbers without using a Sleep call to alter the time seed.
