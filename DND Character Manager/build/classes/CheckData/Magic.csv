If your familiar has any special senses, you also gain the benefits of those senses while you are seeing or hearing through it. While doing so, your body is blind and deaf. You can also cast spells with a range of touch through your familiar as if it has cast them itself, but you must be within 100 feet of it and the familiar uses its reaction to cast the spell. Otherwise the spell is cast as if you had done so yourself. When initiative is rolled, the familiar also rolls, but it can't make an attack. It can take other actions, but if its hit points fall to 0, it disappears until you cast this spell again. You can dismiss the familiar permanently any time you choose, as an action, or you can temporarily dismiss it to a pocket dimension. You can recall your familiar from the pocket dimension, also as an action, to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. If you try to cast this spell when you already have a familiar, you can choose for it to take a new form, but you cannot have more than one."

The surface thoughts of any creature within 30 feet are revealed to you. This spell also allows you to detect the presence of thinking creatures you cannot see, and you must, either at the casting of the spell or as an action, detect the creature's presence first, if you cannot see it. The spell works through most barriers except 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead. This spell does not work on creatures with Intelligence lower than 4 or ones that cannot use language; instead, you will sense nothing. You may also use an action to learn the surface thoughts of another creature, or to go deeper into one whose mind you've already touched. By going deeper, you can learn the target's emotional state, what's important to it in that moment, or the pattern of its logic. if you try to look deeper into a creature's mind, it makes a Wisdom saving throw and the spell ends if it succeeds. The creature will also know that you are there, even if it fails the save, and can make an Intelligence check contested by your own Intelligence check at the end of each of its turns to try and end your probing. If a creature whose thoughts you are reading moves more than 30 feet away from you, you can no longer detect its thoughts."
107,"Enhance Ability","Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer",Transmutation,0,2,"1 action",Touch,"V, S, M, C","Up to 1 hour",-,"You touch a creature and bestow upon it a magical enhancement.

You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect. If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once. Enlarge - The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category - from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target's attack with them deal 1d4 extra damage. Reduce - The target's size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category - from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1)."

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose, such as a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your DM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak. Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed. When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum. While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time.

A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole. This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don't learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense."

Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different form until it leaves the spell's light. On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.

The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn't being carried or worn by another creature. When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled. False Aura - You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as detect magic, that detect magical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object's magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item. Mask - You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin's Divine Sense or the trigger of a sym bol spell.

132,"Phantasmal Force","Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard",Illusion,0,2,"1 action","60 feet","V, S, M, C","Up to 1 minute",Intelligence,"Needed Material - a bit of fleece You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature. The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends. While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall - it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off. An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion."

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it purses the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn't met before the spell expires, the activity isn't preformed. If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends."

You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area. If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet. Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free. A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained. The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire."

Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw. An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such creatures can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth."

The undead creature is under control for 24 hours at which point it no longer follows your will. You can reassert control, for another 24 hours, of up to four of these creatures if you cast this spell on them again before the 24 hours is up. While they are under your control and within 60 feet of you, you can command them as a bonus action. A single command can be issued to as many of your undead minions as you wish and can be specific, like directing movement and what action they will take, or be more general, as in guarding a person or place. They will continue to follow your orders until they are complete or the spell ends, but if you don't command them at all, they will do nothing except defend themselves against attack. You animate or reassert control over two additional undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones."

When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options: Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you. While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing. While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. A remove curse spell ends this effect. At the DM's option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The DM has final say on such a curse's effect. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled.

At the start of you next turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the Etheral Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that rang, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more that one space is equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.

When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see within range. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one. If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by 1d10. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd."

Each beast is also considered fey, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. The DM has the creatures' statistics. When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 5th-level slot. three times as many with a 7th-level slot. four times as many with a 9th-level slot."

When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends. You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph. Explosive Runes - When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one. Spell Glyph - You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding."

No light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the area, and creatures fully within the area are blinded. The void creates a warp in the fabric of space, and the area is difficult terrain. Any creature that starts its turn in the area takes 2d6 cold damage. Any creature that ends its turn in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 acid damage as milky, otherwordly tentacles rub against it."

You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface. Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways: The creature can't willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder. Targets within the cylinder can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature. When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd."
177,"Major Image","Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard",Illusion,0,3,"1 action","120 Feet","V, S, M, C","Up to 10 minutes",-,"Needed Material - a bit of fleece
You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte's stench). As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration."

You are still aware of time passage. You can also cast spells on yourself. You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered, but otherwise are immobile. Minor damage to the stone doesn't hurt you, but destruction enough to make it no longer fit you expels you from the stone and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage. If the stone is completely destroyed or transmuted into another substance, you are expelled and take 50 bludgeoning damage.

It can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the rider has 1 minute to dismount before it fully vanishes.

There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits. If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range.

Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn't return the creature's soul to its body, only its animating spirit.

You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example. Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the DM's discretion. The spell doesn't enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks. If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.

If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.

Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one. Flood - You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts. Part Water - You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored. Redirect Flow - You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. Whirlpool - This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage, this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex."

You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.

You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack" that creature, "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability. You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well. Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it. The DM might allow you to choose different targets.

A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed in appearance. The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it.

When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.

The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it. When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties: Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area. The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it. Sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter. Creatures in the area can't be targeted by divination spells. Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area. Planar travel is blocked within the warded area. Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th.

The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside.

The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.

Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell also ends it.

Corridors: Fog makes the corridors heavily obscured. At each intersection, there is a 50% chance a creature will believe it's going in the opposite direction it chose. You are immune to this chance.
Doors: All doors are magically locked as if by Arcane Lock. You can also hide up to ten doors with a Minor Illusion-like cover to make them appear as sections of the wall.
Stairs: The stairs are filled with a Web. If burned or torn, the strands regrow in 10 minutes.
Other Effects: You can place one of the following effects:
Dancing Lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat.
Magic Mouth in two locations.
Stinking Cloud in two locations. The vapors return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind .
Constant Gust of Wind in one corridor or room.
Suggestion in one location. Any creature that enters or passes through a 5-foot area you choose receives the suggestion mentally.

The whole area radiates magic. Dispel Magic, if successful, removes only one effect.
If you cast this spell in the same place every day for one year, the effects become permanent."
290,Harm,Cleric,Necromancy,0,6,"1 action","60 feet","V, S",Instantaneous,Constitution,"A creature you can see must make a Constitution save. It takes 14d6 necrotic damage on a fail, or half on a success. Also on a fail, its hit point maximum is reduced by the damage it took for 1 hour, but the spell can't reduce it below 1. Creatures immune to disease are unaffected by this spell, and effects that end disease relieve the reduced hit point maximum."
291,Heal,"Cleric, Druid",Evocation,0,6,"1 action","60 feet","V, S",Instantaneous,-,"Choose a creature that you can see. It regains 70 hit points. Blindness, deafness, and any diseases end. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

You bring forth a feast. It takes 1 hour to consume and disappears after, and the effects don't set in until the hour is over. Up to twelve creatures can partake in the feast.
Any creature partaking in the feast is cured of all diseases and poison, becomes immune to poison and being frightened, and makes Wisdom saves with advantage. Its hit point maximum increases by 2d10, and it gains the same number of hit points. These benefits last for 24 hours."
293,"Magic Jar",Wizard,Necromancy,0,6,"1 minute",Self,"V, S, M","Until dispelled",Charisma,"Needed Material: 500gp Gem, Crystal or Ornamental Container
Your soul enters the container you used to cast the spell. While you're in the container, your body is comatose, and you perceive the world from inside the jar. The only action you can do is project your soul up to 100 feet outside of the container. You either return to your body and end the spell, or attempt to possess another humanoid's body. You can't move, use reactions, or perform any other actions while in the jar.
You may only possess humanoids that you can see and that aren't guarded by a Protection from Evil and Good or Magic Circle spell. Your target must make a Charisma save. On a failure, your soul possesses the target and the target's soul is put inside the container. On a success, it knows that you tried to possess it and is immune to your possession for 24 hours.
If you possess a creature, you take control of it and assume all of its game statistics except alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. You also keep your own class features, and don't use class features the target has.
You can use your action to stop possessing and return to the jar if the container is within 100 feet of you. The creature's soul returns to its body.
If the creature's body dies while you possess it, the creature dies and you must make a Charisma save against your spell DC. On a success, if the container is within 100 feet of you, you return to it. Otherwise, you die too.
A creature trapped in the container can see from inside it as normal, but can't move, take actions, or take reactions.
If the spell ends or the container is destroyed, the soul tries to return to its body. This is successful only if the body is alive and within 100 feet of the container; otherwise, the soul dies.
Once the spell ends, the container is destroyed."
294,"Mass Suggestion","Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard",Enchantment,0,6,"1 action","60 feet","V, M","24 hours",Wisdom,"Needed Material: Snake Tongue, Honeycomb/Sweet Oil
You suggest an activity up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see and that can hear and understand you. You're limited to two sentences. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune. The suggestion must be worded to make the action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do something obviously self-harmful ends the spell.
Each target makes a Wisdom save. On failure, it performs the action. The action can continue for the entire duration. If the activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition isn't met before the spell expires, the activity isn't performed. If you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 10 days. At 8th level, it's 30 days. At 9th level spell slot, it's a year and a day."
295,"Move Earth","Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard",Transmutation,0,6,"1 action","120 feet","V, S, M, C","Up tp 2 hours",-,"Needed Material: An Iron Blade and a Small Bag containing a mixture of soils - Clay, Loam, and Sand
Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such change can't exceed half the area's largest dimension So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square's elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.
At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.
Because the terrain's transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can't usually be trapped or injured by the ground's movement.
This spell can't manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.
Similarly, this spell doesn't directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it."
296,"Otiluke's Freezing Sphere",Wizard,Evocation,0,6,"1 action","300 feet","V, S, M",Instantaneous,Constitution,"A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.
If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.
You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling's normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn't already shattered, it explodes.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th."
297,"Otto's Irresistible Dance","Bard, Wizard",Enchantment,0,6,"1 action","30 feet","V, C","Up to 1 minute",Wisdom,"You choose a creature you can see and force it to start dancing in its space. Creatures immune to being charmed are unaffected.
The target is unable to leave its space and uses all its movement to continue the dance. It has disadvantage on Dexterity saves and attacks. Additionally, other creatures have advantage on attacks against it. The target can use its action to make a Wisdom save, ending the spell on a pass."
298,"Planar Ally",Cleric,Conjuration,0,6,"10 minutes","60 feet","V, S",Instantaneous,-,"You ask a being of cosmic power you know for aid. That entity sends a celestial, elemental, or fiend loyal to it to aid you. It appears in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature's name, you can request it, though you might get a different creature anyway.
When the creature appears, it's under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to do something in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task can range from simple to complex. You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.
After the creature completes the task or the duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you. If you are unable to agree on a price, the creature returns to its home plane.
A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points."
299,"Programmed Illusion","Bard, Wizard",Illusion,0,6,"1 action","120 feet","V, S, M","Until dispelled",-,"Needed Material: A Bit of Fleece and Jade Dust worth at least 25 GP
You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.
When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.
The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature."

A wall of ice, either a dome or sphere with a radius of 10 feet or ten contiguously connected 10-foot-square panels, appears on a solid surface. The wall is 1 foot thick. If the wall is placed on a creature's space, the creature makes a Dexterity save and is pushed to one side of the wall. It takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half on a success. Each 10-foot section of the wall has 12 AC and 30 hit points, and is vulnerable to fire damage. If damaged to 0 hit points, it leaves a hole filled with freezing air. The first time a creature moves through the air on a turn, it makes a Constitution save, taking 5d6 cold damage if it fails or half if it succeeds. The damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the air increases by 1d6, for each slot level above 6th."
304,"Wall of Thorns",Druid,Conjuration,0,6,"1 action","120 feet","V, S, M, C","Up to 10 minutes",Dexterity,"You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns.

You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.
When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a dexterity saving throw. On a failed save a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save (rounding up).
A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn, or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one (rounding up).

305,"Wind Walk",Druid,Transmutation,0,6,"1 minute","30 feet","V, S, M","8 hours",-,"You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can't move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.
If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can't land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance."

A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. 
Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The spell's base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6. 
If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes. 
The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th."

During this time, you can move in any direction. If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can see and hear the plane you came from, but everything looks gray and you can't see more than 60 feet.
While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only interact with other creatures on that plane. Creatures not on the Ethereal Plane can't perceive or interact with you, unless a special ability has given them the ability to.
You ignore all objects and effects that aren't on the Ethereal Plane.
When the spell ends, you immediately return to the plane you came from in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a solid object or creature when this happens, you are moved to the nearest unoccupied space and take force damage equal to twice the feet you are moved.
This spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on the Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn't border it.

The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose. A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart. A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area. When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area. A creature inside the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage.

The terrain's general shape remains the same, however, open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy Meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.
Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn't disguise, conceal, or add creatures.
The illusions include audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell's area disappears immediately.
Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain's true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion's presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion."

You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can't attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus, the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can't leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion.

You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Make a melee spell attack against a creature in reach. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma save.

It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the DM's choosing and is no longer blinded.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.
If you use this spell on a creature that has been dead for one year or longer, you can't cast spells, and have disadvantage on all attacks, ability checks, and saves until you finish a long rest."

This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high cylinder centred on a point within range. All creatures and objects that aren't somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.
If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly for the duration.
At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down."
323,Sequester,Wizard,Transmutation,0,7,"1 action",Touch,"V, S, M","Until dispelled",-,"Needed Material: a powder composed of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes
By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes invisible and can't be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.
If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn't grow older.
You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include "after 1,000 years" or "when the tarrasque awakens." This spell also ends if the target takes any damage."

You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half the creature's hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates, except that it is a construct.
The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.
If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.
If you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you created with this spell are instantly destroyed."

You inscribe a glyph either upon a surface or within an object that can be closed to hide it. It can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast the spell, it ends without being triggered. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. Once the glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics, creature kind, or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph.
The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Investigation check to be found.
When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below. Once triggered, the glyph glows a 60-foot-radius dim light sphere for 10 minutes, after which the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates, and any creature that enters the sphere or ends its turn there, is affected.
Death: Each target must make a Constitution save, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half on a success.
Discord: Each target must make a Constitution save. On a failed save, a target is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks for 1 minute.
Fear: Each target must pass a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. While frightened, the target drops whatever it's holding and moves at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns.
Hopelessness: Each target must make a Charisma save. On a failed save, the target can't attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects for 1 minute.
Insanity: Each target must make an Intelligence save. On a failed save, the target can't take actions, can't understand what others say, can't read, speaks gibberish, and has erratic movement for 1 minute.
Pain: Each target must pass a Constitution save or incapacitated for 1 minute.
Sleep: Each target must pass a Wisdom saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to wake it up.

The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully.

Anything the target is wearing or carrying melds into the new form and can't be activated, wielded, or otherwise give benefits. A target takes the beast's statistics except for alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. It also gains the hit points of the beast and is at the maximum health for said beast. While in this form, the target can't speak or cast spells and can only do the actions that the beast could. If a target hits 0 hit points, it reverts to its normal form and resumes the number of hit points it had before transforming. If there is excess damage, it deducts from the target's resumed hit points. However, as long as its normal form isn't reduced to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious."

A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere surrounds you. Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and magic items become normal. The sphere moves with you. Summoned creatures re-appear once the sphere leaves their space, and magic items are restored upon being removed from the sphere. Magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't enter or affect things within it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

Choose a Huge or smaller object, creature, or area no bigger than a 200-foot cube, then specify an intelligent creature. The target gains an aura of antipathy, which repels the intelligent creature, or sympathy, which draws the creature to it. You choose the aura. In the antipathy aura, creatures of the chosen type must make a Wisdom save if they can see the target or when they come within 60 feet of it. If it fails, it's frightened and must use its movement to get to the nearest safe spot where it can't see the target. If the creature gets more than 60 feet away and can't see the target, they are no longer frightened but will become so again if they get within the aura or see the target. The sympathy aura causes creatures of the chosen type to pass a Wisdom save, or use their movement to enter the area if they see the target or move within reach of the target if they're within 60 feet. Once the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away. If the target harms the creature, it can make another Wisdom save. If the creature successfully saves, it's no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling as magical. Additionally, a creature affected can make a Wisdom save every 24 hours.

It takes 1d4 x 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.

Fissures: 1d6 fissures open in the spell's area at the start of your next turn in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell's area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must pass a Dexterity save or fall in. A creature that saves moves with the fissure's edge. A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse.
Structures: The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground when you cast the spell and at the start of your turns. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses. Any creature within half the distance of the structure's height must make a Dexterity save. On a failure, it takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble. It can make a DC 20 Athletics check as an action to escape.

When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment. Burial.

The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal. Hedged Prison.

The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade. Minimus Containment. The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.

The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs. Ending the Spell. During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points. A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.

The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it. 6. Indigo. On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind. While this layer is in place, spells can't be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level. 7. Violet. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the GM's choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a dispel magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects."

You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new form can be any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The creature can't be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you, and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus in place of yours. You can't use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form. You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hitpoints, you aren't knocked unconscious. You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can't use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak. When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state. During this spell's duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value."

Each creature less than 5,000 feet below the cloud makes a Constitution save when it appears, taking 2d6 thunder damage and being deafened for 5 minutes if they fail. The longer you concentrate on this spell, the more effects will occur. Each takes place on a specific round.
Round 2: Each creature and object under the cloud takes 1d6 acid damage.
Round 3: Six lightning bolts all strike different creatures or objects of your choice. A struck creature makes a Dexterity save, taking 10d6 lightning damage if they fail and half if they succeed.
Round 4: Each creature under the cloud takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.
Round 5-10: The area under the cloud becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. In addition, each creature takes 1d6 cold damage and ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. Any fog, mists, and the like, magical or not, are dispersed due to strong winds. The storm is a severe distraction to maintaining concentration on a spell."

No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal. This spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you. In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet from the location where you cast it."

You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into an object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled. This spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn't affected by this spell. Creature into Creature. If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or its level, if the target doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech unless its new form is capable of such actions. The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment. Object into Creature. You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature's size is no larger than the object's size and the creature's challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The DM has the creature's statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement. If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it. Creature into Object. If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form. The creature's statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its normal form."

If the creature's soul is free and willing, it's restored to life with all its hit points. This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs. If the creature was undead, it is restored to its non-undead form. The spell can provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature's name. The creature appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you."

The illusion calls on the creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat.

Alternatively, you create one of the following effects:
A non-magic item worth up to 25,000 gp appears in an empty space on the ground. It can't be more than 300 feet in any dimension.
Up to 20 creatures you can see regain all hit points and end all effects listed in Greater Restoration.
Up to 10 creatures you can see gain resistance to a damage type you choose.
Up to 10 creatures you can see gain immunity to a spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.
You force a re-roll of any roll made within the last round, your turn included. You can force the re-roll to be made with advantage or disadvantage. Additionally, you can choose whether or not to use the re-roll.

You can do effects unlisted by stating your wish as precisely as possible. However, the DM has full ruling on what the wish does. The greater the wish, the greater the likelihood of something going wrong. This can range from the spell failing, to only getting part of the effect, to getting an undesired consequence. If you use Wish to do anything besides duplicate a spell, you suffer the following effects:
Each time you cast a spell, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per spell level. This damage can't be reduced or prevented. This effect ends after a long rest.
Your Strength score becomes 3 if not so already for 2d4 days. If you spend a day doing nothing but resting or light activity, your recovery time decreases by 2 days.
A die that can be split into thirds is rolled. Designate one third before doing so. If you roll a number in this third, you can't cast Wish ever again."
