This spell does not work on creatures with Intelligence lower than 4 or ones that cannot use language; instead, you will sense nothing.

By going deeper, you can learn the target's emotional state, what's important to it in that moment, or the pattern of its logic. if you try to look deeper into a creature's mind, it makes a Wisdom saving throw and the spell ends if it succeeds. The creature will also know that you are there, even if it fails the save, and can make an Intelligence check contested by your own Intelligence check at the end of each of its turns to try and end your probing. If a creature whose thoughts you are reading moves more than 30 feet away from you, you can no longer detect its thoughts."

If the portal would open in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and the casting is lost. The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings filled with mist, hovering inches from the ground and perpendicular to it at the points you choose. A ring is visible only from one side (your choice), which is the side that functions as a portal. Any creature or object entering the portal exits from the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each other; passing through a portal from the nonportal side has no effect. The mist that fills each portal is opaque and blocks vision through it. On your turn, you can rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active side faces in a different direction."

The spell also proofs the area against planar travel. In addition, the spell damages celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. Choose one or more types when you cast the spell. When one enters the spell's area or starts its turn there, it takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage-- your choice when you cast this spell. When you cast this spell, you can make a password.

A wall of ice, either a dome or sphere with a radius of 10 feet or ten contiguously connected 10-foot-square panels, appears on a solid surface. The wall is 1 foot thick. If the wall is placed on a creature's space, the creature makes a Dexterity save and is pushed to one side of the wall. It takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half on a success. Each 10-foot section of the wall has 12 AC and 30 hit points, and is vulnerable to fire damage. If damaged to 0 hit points, it leaves a hole filled with freezing air. The first time a creature moves through the air on a turn, it makes a Constitution save, taking 5d6 cold damage if it fails or half if it succeeds. The damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the air increases by 1d6, for each slot level above 6th."

You can use your action on following turns to change a target into a different form. Anything the target is wearing or carrying melds into the new form and can't be activated, wielded, or otherwise give benefits. A target takes the beast's statistics except for alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. It also gains the hit points of the beast and is at the maximum health for said beast. While in this form, the target can't speak or cast spells and can only do the actions that the beast could. If a target hits 0 hit points, it reverts to its normal form and resumes the number of hit points it had before transforming. If there is excess damage, it deducts from the target's resumed hit points. However, as long as its normal form isn't reduced to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious."

Magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't enter or affect things within it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed.

329,Antipathy/Sympathy,"Druids, Wizards",Abjuration,,8,1 action,60 feet,"V, S, M, C",10 days,-,"Needed Material - Vinegar-soaked alum (antipathy)/honey (sympathy)
Choose a Huge or smaller object, creature, or area no bigger than a 200-foot cube, then specify an intelligent creature. The target gains an aura of antipathy, which repels the intelligent creature, or sympathy, which draws the creature to it. You choose the aura. In the antipathy aura, creatures of the chosen type must make a Wisdom save if they can see the target or when they come within 60 feet of it. If it fails, it's frightened and must use its movement to get to the nearest safe spot where it can't see the target. If the creature gets more than 60 feet away and can't see the target, they are no longer frightened but will become so again if they get within the aura or see the target. The sympathy aura causes creatures of the chosen type to pass a Wisdom save, or use their movement to enter the area if they see the target or move within reach of the target if they're within 60 feet. Once the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away. If the target harms the creature, it can make another Wisdom save. If the creature successfully saves, it's no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling as magical. Additionally, a creature affected can make a Wisdom save every 24 hours. Any creature that successfully saves is immune for 1 minute, then can be affected again."

For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on a point you can see. The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground must make a concentration save if applicable. When you cast this spell, and at the end of your turns, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it's knocked prone. This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.
     Fissures: 1d6 fissures open in the spell's area at the start of your next turn in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell's area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must pass a Dexterity save or fall in. A creature that saves moves with the fissure's edge. A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse.
     Structures: The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground when you cast the spell and at the start of your turns. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses. Any creature within half the distance of the structure's height must make a Dexterity save. On a failure, it takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble. It can make a DC 20 Athletics check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become buried."

Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot is wasted. The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall’s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as described below. The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. An antimagic field has no effect on it, and dispel magic works only against the violet layer. 1. Red. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it. 2. Orange. The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind. 3. Yellow. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it. 4. Green. The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer. 5. Blue. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it. 6. Indigo. On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind. While this layer is in place, spells can’t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.  7. Violet. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the GM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a dispel magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects. "
