This spell does not work on creatures with Intelligence lower than 4 or ones that cannot use language; instead, you will sense nothing.

By going deeper, you can learn the target's emotional state, what's important to it in that moment, or the pattern of its logic. if you try to look deeper into a creature's mind, it makes a Wisdom saving throw and the spell ends if it succeeds. The creature will also know that you are there, even if it fails the save, and can make an Intelligence check contested by your own Intelligence check at the end of each of its turns to try and end your probing. If a creature whose thoughts you are reading moves more than 30 feet away from you, you can no longer detect its thoughts."

 Choose a Huge or smaller object, creature, or area no bigger than a 200-foot cube, then specify an intelligent creature. The target gains an aura of antipathy, which repels the intelligent creature, or sympathy, which draws the creature to it. You choose the aura. In the antipathy aura, creatures of the chosen type must make a Wisdom save if they can see the target or when they come within 60 feet of it. If it fails, it's frightened and must use its movement to get to the nearest safe spot where it can't see the target. If the creature gets more than 60 feet away and can't see the target, they are no longer frightened but will become so again if they get within the aura or see the target. The sympathy aura causes creatures of the chosen type to pass a Wisdom save, or use their movement to enter the area if they see the target or move within reach of the target if they're within 60 feet. Once the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away. If the target harms the creature, it can make another Wisdom save. If the creature successfully saves, it's no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling as magical. Additionally, a creature affected can make a Wisdom save every 24 hours.

It takes 1d4 x 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.

A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must pass a Dexterity save or fall in. A creature that saves moves with the fissure's edge. A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse.
  Structures: The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground when you cast the spell and at the start of your turns. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses. Any creature within half the distance of the structure's height must make a Dexterity save. On a failure, it takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble. It can make a DC 20 Athletics check as an action to escape.

While affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn’t age. Divination spells can’t locate or perceive the target. When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment. Burial. The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it. The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb. Chaining. Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can’t move or be moved by any means until then. The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal. Hedged Prison. The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice. The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade. Minimus Containment. The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can’t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect. The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.Slumber. The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs. Ending the Spell. During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points. A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it. You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding."

Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere of a meteor makes a Dexterity save, taking 20d6 fire and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failure or half as much on a success. If a creature is in the area of more than one meteor, it only takes the damage once. The spell's area spreads around corners. Flammable objects in the area not being worn or carried are set on fire."
351,Power Word Heal,Bards,Evocation,,9,1 action,Touch,"V, S",Instantaneous,-,"A wave of healing energy washes over the creature you touch. The target regains all its hit points. If the creature is charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or stunned, the condition ends. If the creature is prone, it can use its reaction to stand up. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs."
352,Power Word Kill,"Bards, Sorcerers, Warlocks, Wizards",Enchantment,,9,1 action,60 feet,V,Instantaneous,-,"You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see within range to die instantly.

353,Prismatic Wall,Wizards,Abjuration,,9,1 action,60 feet,"V, S",10 minutes,"Constitution, Dexterity","A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick—centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot is wasted. The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall’s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as described below. The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. An antimagic field has no effect on it, and dispel magic works only against the violet layer. 1. Red. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it. 2. Orange. The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind. 3. Yellow. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it. 4. Green. The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer. 5. Blue. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it. 6. Indigo. On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind. While this layer is in place, spells can’t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level. 7. Violet. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the GM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a dispel magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects."

You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new form can be any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The creature can’t be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you, and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus in place of yours. You can’t use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form. You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hitpoints, you aren’t knocked unconscious. You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can’t use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak. When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state. During this spell’s duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value."
355,Storm of Vengeance,Druids,Conjuration,,9,1 action,Sight,"V, S, C",Up to 1 minute,Constitution,"A 360-foot-radius storm cloud appears in the sky at a point you can see. Each creature less than 5,000 feet below the cloud makes a Constitution save when it appears, taking 2d6 thunder damage and being deafened for 5 minutes if they fail. The longer you concentrate on this spell, the more effects will occur. Each takes place on a specific round.
     Round 2: Each creature and object under the cloud takes 1d6 acid damage.
     Round 3: Six lightning bolts all strike different creatures or objects of your choice. A struck creature makes a Dexterity save, taking 10d6 lightning damage if they fail and half if they succeed.
     Round 4: Each creature under the cloud takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.
     Round 5-10: The area under the cloud becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. In addition, each creature takes 1d6 cold damage and ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. Any fog, mists, and the like, magical or not, are dispersed due to strong winds. The storm is a severe distraction to maintaining concentration on a spell."

No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal. This spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you.  In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet from the location where you cast it. "

You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into an object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled. This spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn’t affected by this spell. Creature into Creature. If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or its level, if the target doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech unless its new form is capable of such actions. The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment. Object into Creature. You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature’s size is no larger than the object’s size and the creature’s challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The DM has the creature’s statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement. If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it. Creature into Object. If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form. The creature’s statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its normal form."

If the creature's soul is free and willing, it's restored to life with all its hit points. This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs. If the creature was undead, it is restored to its non-undead form. The spell can provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature's name. The creature appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you."

Each creature in a 30?foot?radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature’s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature’s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature."
360,Wish,"Sorcerers, Wizards",Conjuration,,9,1 action,Self,V,Instantaneous,-,"You can duplicate a spell of level 8 or lower without needing to meet any requirements, material components with a cost included.
Alternatively, you create one of the following effects:
     A non-magic item worth up to 25,000 gp appears in an empty space on the ground. It can't be more than 300 feet in any dimension.
     Up to 20 creatures you can see regain all hit points and end all effects listed in Greater Restoration.
     Up to 10 creatures you can see gain resistance to a damage type you choose.
     Up to 10 creatures you can see gain immunity to a spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.
     You force a re-roll of any roll made within the last round, your turn included. You can force the re-roll to be made with advantage or disadvantage. Additionally, you can choose whether or not to use the re-roll.

You can do effects unlisted by stating your wish as precisely as possible. However, the DM has full ruling on what the wish does. The greater the wish, the greater the likelihood of something going wrong. This can range from the spell failing, to only getting part of the effect, to getting an undesired consequence. If you use Wish to do anything besides duplicate a spell, you suffer the following effects:
     Each time you cast a spell, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per spell level. This damage can't be reduced or prevented. This effect ends after a long rest.
     Your Strength score becomes 3 if not so already for 2d4 days. If you spend a day doing nothing but resting or light activity, your recovery time decreases by 2 days.
     A die that can be split into thirds is rolled. Designate one third before doing so. If you roll a number in this third, you can't cast Wish ever again."
